##Pavement
Cole: Where does it pull the planned date from?
Viani: Artemis. We have to ensure the info gets updated
Robie: Project owners have to update it
Cole: How do you prioritize the PMs to update this?
Robie: Limited extra burden
Cole: Some data in Artemis is good, some is crap. How do we get it correct?
Robie: We're working on it.
Viani: Mimic the KPI process
Cole: When will this go live? 
Viani: By legislature
Cole: Set a deadline for updates from PM
Robie: This will marry up to our push for the snapshot
Symonds: What dat is "Planned start"
Viani: Construction activitiy
Symonds: Structures doesn't have that activity. Policy: Bid add data has to be locked in, everything else is flexible. Will that confuse the public when things change?
Viani: This exposes our data's current state. We need to 
Rodgers: Broaden when it's further out? 4/26/15 changes to "2015 season" or "Spring 15"

_Tabling the project date discussion_

Robie: Universal color scheme? It's a culture change.
Cole: Button for color blindness?
Lofgren: DII has a web colorblind policy

##Bridges

_Data issue_

##Projects

Symonds: Once a project is in construction switch the contact info to resident engineer

Symonds: Filkorn is looking for a single source for project websites

##Maintenance

Cole: The language... "MOB", "MM Plaques" - obscure? Does it have to be one line?
Viani: It will take some work to fix the acronyms
Brown: Should there be a POC for the maintenance activities?
Fitch: Just put "Garage" 
Robie: Maintenance Top 10 vs Maintenance Activities titles
Fitch: I see Maint. Top 10 = top 10 they're doing, top 10 projects. Largest 10
Viani: "Current Maintenance Projects"
Devlin: Plowing? The whole map will be plows in the winter
Viani: Couldn't dig into winter maintenance in this project

Viani: Eventually take some of the static maps into the same platform

White: The public sees it all as road, not paving, maintenance, proejcts, bridges etc. Will the public see a disconnect?
Tetrault: Who will look at the data from the pulbic? Press or media. Or public following a press story. The media says "bridge condition" or "pavement condition", so the public will probably follow that
Hedges: I get a dozen calls a year about bridge condition. They also ask about more detailed metrics. Share links to the dashbaords?
Tetrault: I'm not worried about the public having access to info they see in the press
Fitch: It has to be sustainable. It's great if it answers 90% of the questions. Too big is too hard to maintain. What is the essential information?
Tetrault: 90% of the questions I get are in well maintained data
Viani: We didn't create, we just exposed that data

##Contacts

Hedges: What about contacting about an asset condition? Bridge condition? Pavement condition?
Brown: You mean feedback about a pothole?
White: Those contacts already work.
Fitch: Is this a 24h contact form? Include an emergency contact? If we put our number out we're saying we're available
Scott: I'm going to call the state police. We could include the hours
Fitch: When hiring public outreach coordinators we included language (that the experts said) that we'll return your call within 24 hours. It's about customer satisfaction
Scott: That's an agency policy discussion
Tetrault: The value of the tool is that it reduces the number of phone calls or emails we get. I'd invest the time so that there are fewer phone calls

###Feedback form

Fitch: Is the map open to the public?
Lofgren: No.

Lofgren: We can build a decision tree to route issues to their appropriate person
Fitch: And CC Erik. Some people like to type instead.

##Open data portal

Cole: People could develop apps
Nailor: Encourage hackathons to play with our data
Fitch: Should we put a disclaimer?
